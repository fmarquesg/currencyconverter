Instructions

    1) Start the Spring Boot application by running the main class of the project.
    2) Open a web browser or an HTTP client tool like Postman.
    3) In the address bar of your web browser or HTTP client tool, enter the URL of the endpoint you want to hit.
    4) If the endpoint requires any parameters or data to be sent, include them in the request. This can be done through the URL query string or through the request body, depending on the type of request your endpoint accepts.

Example: http://localhost:8080/conversionresult/USD/4

    5) Click the "Send" button or hit "Enter" to send the request to your endpoint.
    6) The Spring Boot application should process the request and return a response, which will be displayed in your web browser or HTTP client tool.
